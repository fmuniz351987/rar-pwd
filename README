Setup:
You need to have rar installed on your linux machine.
Create a file, e.g., words.txt, and put the first line containing how many combinations of words you want for each password. Every other line should be a single word to be used for password combinations.

Usage:
chmod +x pass_gen.py pass_test.py
./pass_gen.py < words.txt > dict.txt
Edit the first line of dict.txt so it contains the .rar file you want to crack.
./pass_test.py < dict.txt

And pray.
